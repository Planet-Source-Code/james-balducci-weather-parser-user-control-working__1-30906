Put this puppy down on a form, and use UpdateWeather to get the weather
data for the current Zip code. Set the zip code using the ZIP property

Weather1.ZIP = "11756" ' for example

Example:

Weather1.UpdateWeather
MsgBox "Temperature: " & Weather1.Temp ' temperature
MsgBox "Conditions: " & Weather1.Condition ' condition (ie. Cloudy)
MsgBox "Humidity: " & Weather1.Humidity ' Humitity
MsgBox "Feels like: " & Weather1.FeelsLike ' Feels Like (Temp)

would also be my pleasure to get 0 credit for making it. in return just dont
email me asking questions
